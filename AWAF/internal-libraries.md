## Internal Libraries

Even though AWAF is meant to be about principles, we recognise the value of plug-in solutions that “just work”. In this section, we will make recommendations for what libraries you should strongly consider to speed up development in Salesforce.

We are confident in recommending these libraries because their creators have a proven track record of actively supporting the code, helping users, and building a community around their projects. Many of these libraries have multiple contributors, which should ease any worries about using someone else's code in a production environment.

As far as AWAF is concerned, these libraries are inherently part of the framework because they embody the principles AWAF stands for. If better libraries emerge in the future, we hope the community embraces them as part of AWAF, continuing to evolve the framework as needed.

That said, as we stated earlier, **you must be careful when using external libraries as authors may stop supporting them** or may not be available to fix bugs that could impact critical functionality in your org. You use them at your own risk.
