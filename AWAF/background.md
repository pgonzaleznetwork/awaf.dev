As mentioned in the introduction, there isn't a standarised or agreed-upon way to structure an Apex codebase. The closest standard we have is [FFLIB (Apex Enterprise Patterns)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/apex_patterns_sl), which we find unsatisfactory.

To understand the value that AWAF can provide above FFLIB, we must first understand FFLIB's limitations.
