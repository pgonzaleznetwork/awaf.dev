## The Apex Well-Architected Framework

The Apex Well-Architected Framework is meant to provide guiding principles and specific recommendations for structuring your Apex codebase. Many of the recommendations are based on the principles covered in the [Clean Apex Code](https://books.google.ie/books/about/Clean_Apex_Code.html?id=4yEc0QEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) book.

> [!NOTE]
> We see the irony in critiquing the concept of a framework only to propose another. The difference is that FFLIB is an implementation framework that dictates where to put your code because "that's how the framework works." AWAF, on the other hand, is a **principles-based framework** that provides guidelines to help you think about software design.

Our vision is that every team can implement AWAF, yet each implementation can be completely different. In a way, no one should be able to tell you what an org using AWAF looks like; instead, they should be able to tell you what working in such an org feels like. A developer may work on two completely different codebases, yet the experience should feel the same.

It's our hope that this way of thinking inspires you to not only adopt these principles but to share them with your colleagues and friends in the Salesforce ecosystem. Now, let's look at AWAF in detail.
