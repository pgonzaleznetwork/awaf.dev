# Framework Overview

AWAF is based on 11 core themes, and then the framework itself. 

Each theme corresponds to one chapter of the book [Clean Apex Code](https://books.google.ie/books/about/Clean_Apex_Code.html?id=4yEc0QEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y). The themes are the building blocks to help you to think differently about Apex code. 

The framework itself is a set of guiding principles that address the limitations of FFLIB and gives specific guidelines around modelling business logic in Apex. It brings all the 11 themes into a coherent whole.
