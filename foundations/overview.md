# Supporting Principles

Apart from the framework itself, AWAF is supported by 11 principles. This makes it more approachable than FFLIB (Apex Enterprise Patterns), which focuses only on structuring logic. AWAF not only guides how to model business logic in Apex, but also **offers clear principles for writing clean code**.

To be fair, FFLIB never set out to solve the “clean code” problem. But we believe any Apex framework is incomplete without helping developers improve code quality.

Each AWAF principle maps to a chapter of the [Clean Apex Code](https://books.google.ie/books/about/Clean_Apex_Code.html?id=4yEc0QEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) book. This site provides a **preview**, but if you’re serious about these topics, we highly recommend reading the full book.
